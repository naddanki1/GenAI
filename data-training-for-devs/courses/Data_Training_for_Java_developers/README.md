## Description
Data Training for Java developers is aimed to give the engineers strong basics enough for staffing to position implying ETL and other Data skills, especially in Cloud infrastructure.
The program consists of basic and advanced topics with practice which should be studied by mentees in self-study mode.
Mentees work in groups involving mentors in Q&A sessions.

## Course Goal
By the end of this course, you will:
* have basic knowledge on Data Engineering, Spark Basics, Spark SQL, Data flow and pipelining;
* have experience in developing some practical tasks in one of the cloud / Big Data environments:
  * AWS
  * Azure
  * GCP
  * Databricks
* have your knowledge of the stack well organized and improved
* be able to apply the gained experience on real production projects

## Rules of Conduct
The Candidate should:
* have a High motivation for self-development (to aim for maximum progress)
* have enough time for daily self-education (10-12 hours per week)
* Follow expert's requests and recommendations (if experts asks for something - mentee should follow)
* Participate in Q&A sessions and be well-prepared to them (prepare questions beforehand)
* Follow all the processes steps (such as filling in the required blocks at Learn educational plan for verification by the experts)
* Participate in a final theory exam and prepare a final practical task for mentors' review.
